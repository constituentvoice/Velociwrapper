0.1.0
    - initial release
0.1.1
    - bugfixes
0.1.2
    - MOAR bug fixes
0.1.3
    - Fixed issues with pagination
    - Fixed issue where some values were not copied

0.1.4
    - Fixed deepcopy of shared resources (specifically self._es)

0.2.0
    - Calls to _create_search_params() create the native parameters to send to
      elastic search and then remove the settings from the object. This allows
      the collection object to be used for a new search. The drawback is
      subsequent calls to all() will not work as expected.
    - added functionality for one() to return the first result of a query
    - Raises AttributeError if an attribute doesn't exist (previously returned
      None but we have now considered this a bug)
    - Fixed bugs related to _set_by_query not being set
    - Fixed _deleted not getting set
    - Added relationship functionality
        - relationships can be specified on single columns
        - setting of a model on a relationship attribute does not yet work

0.2.1
    - reverted _create_search_params() change. Search paramters stay. Broke
      too much stuff.
    - added clear_previous_search() to clear the search and reuse the
      collection

0.2.2
    - bugfix to make VWCollection extend object

0.2.3
    - added function for geo searches

0.2.4
    - added sort()
    - added range()
    - BUG: range() doesn't work with other searches. To be fixed.

0.2.5
    - drew fixed broken delete()

0.2.6
    - ???

0.2.7
    - added delete() and delete_in() to collections

0.2.8
    - added commit() to bulk commit

0.2.9
    - bulk commit now returns the status of each commit
    - fixed date time format to work with bulk commit

0.2.10
    - added callback argument to commit

0.2.11
    - fixed collection calling wrong variable name when a custom index is
      specfied
    - velociwrapper.__version__ returns the version number of the module now

0.2.12
    - allow _create_source_document() to have a specified date or datetime
      format
    - fixed to_dict() to return date_time format in true ISO 0000-00-00
      00:00:00
    - fixed date object creation being turned into datetime

0.2.13
    - fix get_in() to properly use _create_obj_list()
    - get_in() no longer catches exceptions (was returning an empty list)
    - _create_obj_list() filters out docs that returned found: False to
      prevent an exception when creating the object
      - this has the effect of returning all found documents from list calls
      - instead of throwing exceptions / returning empty if a single doc fails
      - we believe this was the original intended behavior
    - Fixed get_like_this()

0.2.14
    - fixed all() and search() (broken by the last update!)

0.2.15
    - fixed empty list passed to get_in() throwing exception

1.0.0
    - Split the module into multiple files
    - moved module configuration into velociwrapper.config
    - added types that coorespond to types used in ElasticSearch
    - added mapper tools to include reindex and create index functionality
    - changed filter_by() to use Query DSL
        - intellegently uses filters and falls back to queries when filtering
          is not possible
        - filter mode works like exact()
        - id/ids key creates the special "ids" filter
    - added exact()
        - search for the exact phrase
        - can be combined with other queries using filter_by (but not ids)
        - will warn if the search is a string but the field is analyzed
        - can accept a list
    - range() now works with other searchs
    - search() may not always work with other searches due to nature of
      QueryDSL
    - wrote some documentation in the README.rst

1.0.1
    - fixed es_types.is_analyzed returning False on lists and objects
    - fixed syntax error in collections, prevented filter_by kwargs from
      accepting list values

1.0.2
    - fixed date parsing when converting to ESType
    - changed Date() and DateTime() to accept a date or datetime (respectivly)
      on __init__()
    - fixed incorrect version number
    - changed setup.py to use the version from the module

1.0.3
    - fixed datetimes being converted to date
    - fixed microseconds being added to datetimes sent to the server (and
      throwing exceptions)

1.0.4
    - fixed a bug that prevented defaults from being set when objects are
      created

1.0.5
    - fixed so VWBase objects can be pickled

1.0.6
    - fixed collections references VWBase before it was imported

1.0.7
    - fixed datetime sending "datetime" as type to Elasticsearch (should send
      date)

1.0.8
    - adds Array() type to ESTypes. Allows to specify an array of various
      ESTypes

1.0.9
    - fixes pickling VWBase objects causing existing instances to lose
      connection to elasticsearch (because the _es attribute is a static
      attribute)
    - fixes mapper.reindex() to ignore subclasses that have no __type__
      attribute. Such subclasses are treated as helpers that actual models are
      derived from

1.0.10
    - added get_server_mapping() to Mapper. Allows inspection of what the
      server actually has rather than what the code says.
    - fixed GeoPoint ESType returning the wrong type to elasticsearch
    - fixed setup.py failing due to missing imports when looking for version
      before dependencies are resolved.
    - updated documentation

1.0.11
    - added multi_match()

1.0.12
    - fixed body not being propertly specified on reindex(). Caused explicit
      mapping to be deleted

2.0 
    - rewrite of much of the internal query system
    - created qdsl.py module to output parts of Query DSL by calling functions
    - created querybuilder class that uses the QDSL functions and represents
      the internal query state
        - much easier to chain calls together
        - no longer has to traverse the tree of JSON/dictionary to find where
          to place new arguments
        - all search methods (in collection.py) now use the querybuilder / qdsl
    - Created VWCollectionGen generator object which is now returned by all()
      and get_in()
        - vastly improves performance on large queries
        - items in the generator can still be referenced by index
    - added callbacks / events
        - several built-in events
        - events can be added and triggered
        - global event / callback system. Callbacks added to models exist for
          all models of the same type

2.0.5 
    - consolidated version number
    - fixed a bug in callbacks
    - fixed bool type only accepting integers
    - fixed _create_obj() being called multiple times
    - fixed collection generator crash when a document has no _source

2.0.6
    - first public release
    - fixed version numbers
2.0.7
    - Better PEP-8 complience (not 100% complete yet)
    - added VWBase.collection() which returns a defined collection
      for a model or a new base collection if one isn't defined.
    - fixed VWBase.more_like_this() not working (collection.py has been merged
      with base.py
    - other minor fixes

2.0.8
    - fixed filter_by() using terms:{} on an analyzed field when passed a list
